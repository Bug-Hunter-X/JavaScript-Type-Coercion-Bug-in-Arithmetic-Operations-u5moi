# JavaScript Type Coercion Bug

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in JavaScript related to type coercion during arithmetic operations. JavaScript's dynamic typing system can cause unexpected behavior when performing calculations involving numbers and strings.

The `bug.js` file contains a simple example showing how mixing data types (numbers and strings) in addition and subtraction operations can lead to unexpected results due to automatic type coercion.

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates how to resolve this issue by explicitly type-checking inputs or using a stricter type system (e.g. TypeScript).
